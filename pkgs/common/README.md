# common

The idea is for you to put the common (duh) code in here. Could be stuff that works across the mobile+web, could be just your endpoint server. whatever it is, put it here so that it doesn't have to be duplicated across 3 different spaces.


To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.30. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
